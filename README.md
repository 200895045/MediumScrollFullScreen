## Description

MediumScrollFullScreen is really similar to menu in scroll of real Medium for iOS.

In reference to [NJKScrollFullScreen](https://github.com/ninjinkun/NJKScrollFullScreen), I implemented MediumScrollFullScreen.

1. The easiest way to get started is to use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/). Add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby

# The following is a Library of Swift.
pod 'MediumScrollFullScreen'
```

2. Delete status bar by editting info.plist.

3. You have to make a change to a specific file. (In sample case, a specific file is WebViewController.swift.)
